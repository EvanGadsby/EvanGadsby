Hello, my name is Evan Gadsby and thanks for dropping by! I am a Computer Informations Student at Mount Royal University and this Github contains projects I have worked on, 
either individually or as part of a group. I am interested in branching out into new programming languages and learning new skills (discord bots have been something I want
to work with more).
